# Skin-disease-classification

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying skin diseases based on dermatology images. The model is trained to recognize various skin conditions, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
- **Model Architecture:** We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to effectively capture patterns and features in skin images.
- **Performance:** The model has been evaluated on a separate test set, achieving high accuracy in classifying different skin diseases.

## Disease Classes

The model classifies images into the following skin disease classes:

1. **Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae (akiec)**
2. **Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)**
3. **Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)**
4. **Dermatofibroma (df)**
5. **Melanocytic nevi (nv)**
6. **Melanoma (mel)**
7. **Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage (vasc)**

The model is yet to be converted to a form such that it will be usable in an android application.
